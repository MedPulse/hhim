# General Rules & Policies

## Admissions

- When you are on call and on another specialty rotation, you STOP admitting/consulting at 4PM and you will begin admitting patients from ED (sometimes med consults from the floor).
- Seniors **MUST** supervise interns while they are admitting patients
- This means that the senior will see, interview, and observe the intern while interviewing and admitting the patient
- Interns are **required** to report to the chief resident or PD if this isn't happening 

## Handoff
_**When and where do signouts occur?**_

- MIOC signs out to ICU between 5-6am and this can be via phone (though in person encouraged)
- MIOC signs out to House intern or resident between 7-8am <ins>in person</ins>. Only exception is if intern is busy  completing an admission or attending to a code, then verbal sign-out is acceptable. 

## HACC
**_Who holds pager when resident is in clinic?_**

- If on call and in clinic, pager must be given to pre-call resident
- If pre-call resident also in clinic, then pager goes to resident on renal or endocrine
- Avoid giving pager to resident on GI or Cardiology (busier rotations) but CAN hold if no one else available

## Communication
- Pages should be returned within 10 minutes of receipt
- If in the middle of a procedure or code, ask someone (i.e. nurse) to inform person paging that you will respond after you are done


## Consults

- **Neuro consults:** During after hours (eg, after 6PM), place consult into Epic and also call the neurologist to speak with them directly. The call for the consult can happen early the following morning, or immediately at the time of seeing the patient (if it's urgent/emergent). But all consults must be called.


## Order Troubleshooting

- **Holding medications:** utilize the 'Hold' button in Manage Orders. Do not use communication orders to hold medications.

## Attending to Codes

_**Who runs codes for house teams?**_

- Residents on house have 1st dibs to run code rapids and blues on their house patients. If you want to run the code, please declare _"I am Dr. X, this is a house case and I will be running the code."_ If you do not feel comfortable, you may remain in the room and help assist, but you will likely not be the main clinician making decisions.

- If you run the code, you MUST write a code note. If you have questions about this, or the format, please call, text or email the PD.

## Didactic Attendance

- Attendance is required for all didactic activities unless specified otherwise
- Sign-in to medtrics is required. Notify chief resident via email if you forgot to sign in but were present. They will only grant changes for the last 30 days. 

_**Who is exempt from didactics?**_

- Residents rotating at sites that are **off campus** or more than **15 minutes** away are exempt from attending morning report, noon conference, ultrasound sessions, board review sessions
- These rotations include USC electives, CS electives, City of Hope electives
