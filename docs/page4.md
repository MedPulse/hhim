## Rounding
When pre-rounding – Come before 6am. Look at the orders written overnight and ask your cross cover why they made a change. What prompted them to change the vent/start pressors/extubate etc. The expectation is that you have seen all of your patients and reviewed their information PRIOR to morning rounds.

Sign outs and cross-cover are critical– The MICU is an around the clock endeavor. Thus, our mentality is that each MICU patient is a communal patient. Your sign out and presentations on rounds are ways you communicate your plan and anticipated problems to the cross-covering team. High quality sign out and presentations are the only way to deliver quality around the clock critical care.

- Everyone should know each patient in the MICU
- For the post call team, the APN/ED dayfloat are designated “helpers”, especially for procedures, roadtrips, etc
- Call consults early – you know your patients the best
- Complete bedside procedures EARLY, which means OBTAIN CONSENT and OPTIMIZE COAGS for procedures early
- Maintain active type and screens and put blood consents in the CHART for patients who require blood products
- Have family contact information and any limits of care (code status) on sign out
- X-cover patients going to the floor should be given to appropriate service (GENS, HONC, etc)
- ASK whether X-cover spoke to floor team about your patients who went out overnight

### CRRT

#### Types

- **CVVHD**: diffusion requires dialysate fluid
- **CVVH**: convection requires repladcement fluid
- **CVVHDF**: diffusion + convection require dialysate + replacement fluid

#### Indications

- **A**: acidosis (severe)
- **E**: electrolytes (essential hyperkalemia)
- **I**: intoxication (SLIME - salicylates, Li+, isopropanol, methanol, ethylene glycol)
- **O**: overload (volume overload; diuretic refractory)
- **U**: uremia (encephalopathy - most common, uremic bleeding, uremic pericarditis)

CRRT **specific** indications:
- AKI or ESRD with hemodynamic instability
- Continuous volume control, solute control and/or or toxin clearance Post-head trauma, intracranial bleed, and some neurosurgical procedures

Note that because CRRT runs continuously (24/7), it is slower, and while it may be able to remove more volume in 24h, it may not correct imbalances (eg., electrolytes) as quickly as HD. If a pt is hemodynamically unstable (in shock / on pressors), they generally require CRRT.

#### Access
- **R IJV** - preferred; 15-20cm catheter (most pts need 20cm, based on height) 
- **L IJV** - ↑ risk catheter malfunction; 20-24cm catheter (most pts need 24cm) 
- **Femoral Vein** - ↑ risk of infection in pts with ↑ BMI; 24-30cm catheter
